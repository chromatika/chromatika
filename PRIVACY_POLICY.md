Privacy Policy

Effective Date: [2025-03-01]

[chromatika] ("the App") is a standalone application that does not collect, store, or share any personal data.

1. No Data Collection

The App operates entirely offline and does not transmit or collect any information from users. There is no login, analytics, tracking, or any form of data gathering.

2. No Internet Access

The App does not use the internet or any network connections. All functionality is self-contained within the device.

3. No Third-Party Services

Since the App does not connect to the internet, it does not integrate with third-party services, including but not limited to analytics providers, advertisers, or external APIs.

4. User Control and Security

Because the App does not collect data, users do not need to manage or request data deletion. The App respects user privacy by design.

5. Changes to This Privacy Policy

If any changes are made to how the App operates, this Privacy Policy will be updated accordingly. Users will be notified through the App or an official update.
